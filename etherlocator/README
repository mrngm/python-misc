etherlocator is an extension to ethergids, providing a somewhat nicer overview
of information about connected devices to the university network in Nijmegen.
Given a location file (not included), it can display the location of the
wireless access point a client is connected to.

By default, it only show results from "today", i.e. the current date is used to
filter the results. This might change in a future version.
