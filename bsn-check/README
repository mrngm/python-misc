bsn-check is a small program to validate a BSN (BurgerServiceNummer, the Dutch
name for what used to be called a `SoFi-nummer', or Social Security Number).

The BSN is, on its own, a number without any information attached. One cannot
extract information about date of birth or gender (point 4.1 in [1]).

The number consists of 9 digits (or, when the length is 8 digits, a 0 is
prepended to the number, effectively making its length 9). The last digit is the
check digit. The check digit is generated by the so-called `elf-proef', or
(freely translated) `eleven test'[2].

``digits[pos]'' indicate the digit on index `pos' in the 9-digit BSN, where
pos=0 is the first digit, pos=1 the second etc.
The check is as follows:
* Multiply digit[0] with 9
* Multiply digit[1] with 8
* [..]
* Multiply digit[6] with 3
* Multiply digit[7] with 2
* Sum above outcomes (sum_outcome)
* Divide the sum by eleven
* The remainder of the division is digit[8], unless it is 10. (remainder)
** If the remainder is 10, then the check digit is 0. (corrected_remainder)
* BSN is valid if the remainder or corrected_remainder is digit[8]

* Alternatively: evaluate (sum_outcome % 11 == digit[8]) for a valid BSN
* Alternatively: evaluate ((sum_outcome - digit[8]) % 11 == 0) for a valid BSN
