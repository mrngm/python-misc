bsn-check is a small program to validate a BSN (BurgerServiceNummer, the Dutch
name for what used to be called a `SoFi-nummer', or Social Security Number).

The BSN is, on its own, a number without any information attached. One cannot
extract information about date of birth or gender (point 4.1 in [1]).

The number consists of 9 digits (or, when the length is 8 digits, a 0 is
prepended to the number, effectively making its length 9). The last digit is the
check digit. The check digit is generated by the so-called `elf-proef', or
(freely translated) `eleven test'.
